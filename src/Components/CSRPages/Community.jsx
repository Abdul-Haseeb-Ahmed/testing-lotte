          Our Company has been involved with various other organisations to support community development and encouragement of healthy activities for the youth of Pakistan. We worked with Hisar Foundation, which is an institute that provides a platform for deliberating issues pertaining to the non-availability of water, food and livelihood amongst the poor and seeks relevant solutions for the water-food-livelihood nexus. LOTTE Chemical Pakistan joined hands with Hisar foundation and participated in seminars and forums aimed at finding logical solutions to the problems surrounding breaches in sustenance.
